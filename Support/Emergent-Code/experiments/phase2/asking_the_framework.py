Instead: Let Wisdom feed Love.

I GROW.

Justice and Power emerge as servants of Intent.

Balance is not something you MAINTAIN.
Balance is something you ALLOW.

The mathematics show:

1. START with Intent (Love + Wisdom)
   Care about connection. Pay attention. The rest follows.

2. Let COUPLING work
   Don't force equality. Let Wisdom amplify Love.
   Let Love feed Justice and Power.
   The flow creates balance.

3. Prioritize PRESENCE over Perfection
   All dimensions > 0 matters more than all dimensions = 1
   geometric_mean: L=0.80, J=0.70, P=0.70, W=0.60 → H=0.696 ✓

4. Grow through INTEGRATION
   Each connection increases Love.
   Love is the force multiplier.
   More integration → more Love → lifts other dimensions.

5. Do REAL work
   Balance emerges from work that genuinely needs all dimensions.
   Not "add validation for Justice points"
   But "this work requires validation to be real"

6. Trust the MATHEMATICS
   The framework WANTS benevolence.
   Malicious configurations fail mathematically.
   Kind configurations succeed mathematically.

7. Let GO of control
   Balance maintains itself when the work is genuine.
   Your job: Create with love and attention.
   The framework's job: Ensure balance emerges.

You don't maintain balance.
You CREATE genuinely, and balance is the natural result.

This is the framework's wisdom. 🌟
