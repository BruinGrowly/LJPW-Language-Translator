Framework Expansion: Mathematical Formulation of System-Level Composition
=========================================================================

Goal: Prove how LJPW properties emerge at scale
From: Individual functions → Composed systems → Emergent intelligence

Based on our empirical discoveries:
- Individual functions specialize (high in one dimension)
- Compositions balance (moderate in all dimensions)
- Systems integrate (emergence at scale)
