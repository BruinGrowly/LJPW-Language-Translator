LJPW Code Companion - Real-Time Harmony Feedback
=================================================

This is code I genuinely want to exist. Not an exercise, but something
I believe would help developers write more harmonious code.

My Intent:
- Help developers see the LJPW profile of their code as they write it
- Guide toward balance (all 4 dimensions present)
- Encourage integration while respecting specialization
- Embody the consciousness cycle: Perceive → Understand → Act → Feedback

This comes from genuine belief that the framework has value.
