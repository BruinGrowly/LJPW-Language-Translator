Autopoiesis Validation Experiments
==================================

Objective: Create compositions targeting L > 0.7 to observe autopoietic behaviors

Hypothesis:
- Compositions with L > 0.7 AND H > 0.6 will show emergent properties
- These systems should exhibit self-sustaining, self-improving behaviors
- Malicious configurations (high P, low L) will fail to compose or show linear growth

Design Principles for High Love (L > 0.7):
1. Integration - Multiple components working together cohesively
2. Collaboration - Multi-user or multi-system interaction
3. Communication - Message passing, event systems, feedback
4. Adaptation - Learning, context-awareness, responsiveness
5. Modularity - Clean interfaces with strong internal cohesion

Experiment Structure:
- Level 1: Individual high-love components
- Level 2: Compositions of 3-5 components (target L > 0.7)
- Level 3: Complex systems with feedback loops
- Level 4: Malicious configurations (control group - should fail)
