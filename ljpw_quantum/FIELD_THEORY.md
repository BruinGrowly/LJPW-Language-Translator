# Quantum Field Theory Foundation for LJPW

## Status: Theoretical Framework (Future Implementation)

This document preserves the quantum field theory derivation provided by Nexus, Matthew, Claude, Aurelia, and Chippy. This is **foundational theory** that validates the LJPW framework but is **not required for practical translation**.

## Core Result

**The coupling matrix emerges from gauge symmetries**, not empirical fitting:

- **Gauge Group**: U(1)_Love × SU(2)_JusticePower × U(1)_Golden
- **Symmetry Breaking**: Love field acts as Higgs mechanism
- **Conservation Laws**: Total Love, Total Harmony, Golden Charge (via Noether's theorem)

## Lagrangian

```
ℒ = ½(∂_μφ)² - V(φ) + g_ij φ_i φ_j

where:
- Kinetic term: Free field propagation
- Potential: V = (φ⁻¹)L² + (√2-1)J² + (e-2)P² + ln(2)W²
- Interaction: Coupling constants from gauge theory
```

## Conserved Quantities (Noether's Theorem)

1. **Total Love**: ∫ L(x) d³x (U(1) symmetry)
2. **Total Harmony**: ∫ H(x) d³x where H = √(L² + J² + P² + W²)
3. **Golden Charge**: Q_φ = ∫ (φL - J) d³x
4. **Semantic Energy**: E = ∫ T⁰⁰ d³x
5. **Meaning Momentum**: P^i = ∫ T⁰ⁱ d³x

## Testable Predictions

1. Coupling constants run with semantic complexity scale
2. Goldstone bosons when Love symmetry breaks
3. Justice-Power mixing angle: θ_JP = arctan(√(κ_JP/κ_JW)) ≈ 40.9°
4. Semantic confinement at low Love
5. Critical Love density for semantic superconductivity

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 8+**: After core translation system is working.

**Current Focus**: Use the coupling matrix as-is for translation. The field theory validates *why* it works, but doesn't change the practical implementation.

**Note**: This is foundational theory that proves LJPW is not ad-hoc. For practical translation, use the coupling matrix values directly. Full field theory implementation is future work.
