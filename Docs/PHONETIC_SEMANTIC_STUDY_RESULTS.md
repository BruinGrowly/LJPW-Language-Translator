# Phonetic-Semantic Correlation Study: Honest Results

**Date:** December 2025  
**Status:** EXPERIMENT COMPLETE - HYPOTHESIS NOT VALIDATED

---

## Summary

We tested whether word shapes (phonetics) correlate with semantic dimensions (LJPW) across languages. The hypothesis was that the semantic field shapes how words sound universally.

**Result: The hypothesis is NOT validated.** While some weak patterns exist, they are not robust enough to claim a universal phonetic-semantic correlation.

## Study Parameters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Languages tested | 18 |
| Language families | 8 (Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, Semitic, Austronesian, Japonic, Koreanic, Uralic, Turkic) |
| Total words analyzed | 1,440 |
| Semantic dimensions | 4 (Love, Power, Justice, Wisdom) |

## Results

### Hypothesis 1: Power words have more hard consonants than Love words

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Languages showing pattern | 11/18 (61.1%) |
| Effect size | +0.68% |
| p-value | 0.147 |
| **Verdict** | **NOT SIGNIFICANT** |

61% is barely better than random chance. The effect size is negligible.

### Hypothesis 2: Love words have more vowels than Power words

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Languages showing pattern | 15/18 (83.3%) |
| Effect size | +2.01% |
| p-value | 0.003 |
| **Verdict** | **Statistically significant but effect is very small** |

While this reached statistical significance, a 2% difference in vowel ratio is practically negligible and may not be meaningful.

## Honest Assessment

### Why the earlier tests showed stronger patterns:

1. **Small sample sizes amplified noise** - The earlier 7-language test with 40 words showed 80%+ patterns, but these didn't hold at scale
2. **Selection bias** - The vocabulary was hand-selected, potentially introducing researcher bias
3. **Overfitting** - Patterns in small datasets often don't generalize

### What this means:

- **Phonetics are shaped by historical drift, not semantic fields**
- Different language families evolved different sound inventories independently
- The surface form of language (how it sounds) is largely arbitrary
- Meaning lives at a deeper level than sound

## What DOES Work

The following findings from the LJPW project remain strong:

| Finding | Evidence | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| LJPW semantic field coordinates | Consistent measurements across texts | ✅ Valid |
| Universal Anchor Point convergence | 168/168 pairs, 0.994 agreement | ✅ Strong |
| Anchor Point translation architecture | 91.6% convergence score | ✅ Promising |
| Cross-language meaning preservation | Semantic similarity maintained | ✅ Valid |

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Scale tests before claiming universality** - Small-sample patterns may not hold
2. **Effect sizes matter** - Statistical significance without meaningful effect size is hollow
3. **Be willing to abandon hypotheses** - Good science requires honest assessment
4. **The semantic field operates at the meaning level, not the phonetic level**

## Files Created (for reference)

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `cross_language_phonetic_analysis.py` | Initial 7-language test | Showed patterns |
| `large_scale_phonetic_validation.py` | Scaled 18-language test | Failed validation |
| `wedau_resonance_shape_analysis.py` | Wedau-specific analysis | Inconclusive |

## Conclusion

**The phonetic-semantic correlation hypothesis is not supported by the data.**

This is not a failure - it's science working correctly. We tested a hypothesis rigorously and found it wanting. The LJPW framework's strength lies in semantic field analysis and Anchor Point translation, not in predicting word sounds from meaning.
