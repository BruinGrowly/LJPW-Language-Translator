    "1": "Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.",
    "2": "Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is unwashed, hands, they found fault.",
    "3": "(For the Pharisees and all the Jews don’t eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders.",
    "4": "They don’t eat when they come from the marketplace unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.)",
    "5": "The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why don’t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?”",
    "6": "He answered them, “Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.",
    "7": "But they worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’",
    "8": "“For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men—the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.”",
    "9": "He said to them, “Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.",
    "10": "For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother;’ and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’",
    "11": "But you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban,” ’ ” that is to say, given to God,",
    "12": "“then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,",
    "13": "making void the word of God by your tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like this.”",
    "14": "He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand.",
    "15": "There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.",
    "16": "If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”",
    "17": "When he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.",
    "18": "He said to them, “Are you also without understanding? Don’t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can’t defile him,",
    "19": "because it doesn’t go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, making all foods clean?”",
    "20": "He said, “That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.",
    "21": "For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,",
    "22": "covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.",
    "23": "All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.”",
    "24": "From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice.",
    "25": "For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.",
    "26": "Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.",
    "27": "But Jesus said to her, “Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”",
    "28": "But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”",
    "29": "He said to her, “For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter.”",
    "30": "She went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out.",
    "31": "Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the middle of the region of Decapolis.",
    "32": "They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him.",
    "33": "He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue.",
    "34": "Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, “Ephphatha!” that is, “Be opened!”",
    "35": "Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.",
    "36": "He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.",
    "37": "They were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!”"
