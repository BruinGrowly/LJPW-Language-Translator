    "7": "Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea,",

    "9": "He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn’t press on him.",

    "23": "He summoned them, and said to them in parables, “How can Satan cast out Satan?",
    "24": "If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.",

    "26": "If Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can’t stand, but has an end.",
    "27": "But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder unless he first binds the strong man; then he will plunder his house.",
    "28": "Most certainly I tell you, all sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme;",
    "29": "but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation.”",
    "30": "—because they said, “He has an unclean spirit.”",
    "31": "His mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.",
