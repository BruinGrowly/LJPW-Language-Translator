    "1": "As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.",
    "2": "His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”",
    "3": "Jesus answered, “This man didn’t sin, nor did his parents; but, that the works of God might be revealed in him.",
    "4": "I must work the works of him who sent me while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.",
    "5": "While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”",
    "6": "When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man’s eyes with the mud,",
    "7": "and said to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which means “Sent”). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.",
    "8": "The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, “Isn’t this he who sat and begged?”",
    "9": "Others were saying, “It is he.” Still others were saying, “He looks like him.” He said, “I am he.”",
    "10": "They therefore were asking him, “How were your eyes opened?”",
    "11": "He answered, “A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, ‘Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.’ So I went away and washed, and I received sight.”",
    "12": "Then they asked him, “Where is he?” He said, “I don’t know.”",
    "13": "They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.",
    "14": "It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.",
    "15": "Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see.”",
    "16": "Some therefore of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, because he doesn’t keep the Sabbath.” Others said, “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” There was division among them.",
    "17": "Therefore they asked the blind man again, “What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?” He said, “He is a prophet.”",
    "18": "The Jews therefore didn’t believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,",
    "19": "and asked them, “Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”",
    "20": "His parents answered them, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;",
    "21": "but how he now sees, we don’t know; or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself.”",
    "22": "His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.",
    "23": "Therefore his parents said, “He is of age. Ask him.”",
    "24": "So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, “Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.”",
    "25": "He therefore answered, “I don’t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see.”",
    "26": "They said to him again, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”",
    "27": "He answered them, “I told you already, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don’t also want to become his disciples, do you?”",
    "28": "They insulted him and said, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.",
    "29": "We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we don’t know where he comes from.”",
    "30": "The man answered them, “How amazing! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.",
    "31": "We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God, and does his will, he listens to him.",
    "32": "Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.",
    "33": "If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”",
    "34": "They answered him, “You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?” Then they threw him out.",
    "35": "Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, “Do you believe in the Son of God?”",
    "36": "He answered, “Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?”",
    "37": "Jesus said to him, “You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.”",
    "38": "He said, “Lord, I believe!” and he worshiped him.",
    "39": "Jesus said, “I came into this world for judgment, that those who don’t see may see; and that those who see may become blind.”",
    "40": "Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, “Are we also blind?”",
    "41": "Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, ‘We see.’ Therefore your sin remains."
