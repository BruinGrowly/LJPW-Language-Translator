    "7": "If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on, you know him, and have seen him.”",
    "8": "Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us.”",
    "9": "Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you such a long time, and do you not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father. How do you say, ‘Show us the Father?’",
    "10": "Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I tell you, I speak not from myself; but the Father who lives in me does his works.",
    "11": "Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or else believe me for the very works’ sake.",

    "18": "I will not leave you orphans. I will come to you.",
    "19": "Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more; but you will see me. Because I live, you will live also.",
    "20": "In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.",
    "21": "One who has my commandments and keeps them, that person is one who loves me. One who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will reveal myself to him.”",
    "22": "Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, “Lord, what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?”",
    "23": "Jesus answered him, “If a man loves me, he will keep my word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him.",
    "24": "He who doesn’t love me doesn’t keep my words. The word which you hear isn’t mine, but the Father’s who sent me.",
    "25": "I have said these things to you while still living with you.",
    "26": "But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things, and will remind you of all that I said to you.",
    "27": "Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you; not as the world gives, I give to you. Don’t let your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.",
    "28": "You heard how I told you, ‘I go away, and I come to you.’ If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I said ‘I am going to my Father;’ for the Father is greater than I.",
    "29": "Now I have told you before it happens so that when it happens, you may believe.",
    "30": "I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world comes, and he has nothing in me.",
    "31": "But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, even so I do. Arise, let’s go from here."
