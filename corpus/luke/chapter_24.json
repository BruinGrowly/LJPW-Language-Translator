    "5": "Becoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth. They said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead?",
    "6": "He isn’t here, but is risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee,",

    "8": "They remembered his words,",
    "9": "returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.",

    "20": "and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.",
    "21": "But we were hoping that it was he who would redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.",
    "22": "Also, certain women of our company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb;",
    "23": "and when they didn’t find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.",
    "24": "Some of us went to the tomb, and found it just like the women had said, but they didn’t see him.”",
    "25": "He said to them, “Foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!",
    "26": "Didn’t the Christ have to suffer these things and to enter into his glory?”",

    "30": "When he had sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks. Breaking it, he gave it to them.",
    "31": "Their eyes were opened and they recognized him, then he vanished out of their sight.",
    "32": "They said to one another, “Weren’t our hearts burning within us, while he spoke to us along the way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?”",
    "33": "They rose up that very hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,",
    "34": "saying, “The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!”",
    "35": "They related the things that happened along the way, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.",
    "36": "As they said these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, “Peace be to you.”",
    "37": "But they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.",
    "38": "He said to them, “Why are you troubled? Why do doubts arise in your hearts?",
    "39": "See my hands and my feet, that it is truly me. Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn’t have flesh and bones, as you see that I have.”",
    "40": "When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.",
    "41": "While they still didn’t believe for joy, and wondered, he said to them, “Do you have anything here to eat?”",
    "42": "They gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.",
    "43": "He took them, and ate in front of them.",
    "44": "He said to them, “This is what I told you, while I was still with you, that all things which are written in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me must be fulfilled.”",
    "45": "Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the Scriptures.",
    "46": "He said to them, “Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,",
    "47": "and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.",
    "48": "You are witnesses of these things.",
    "49": "Behold, I send out the promise of my Father on you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.”",
    "50": "He led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.",
    "51": "While he blessed them, he withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven.",
    "52": "They worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,",
    "53": "and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen."
